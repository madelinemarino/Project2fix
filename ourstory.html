		If you're in search of the best slice of chocolate cake in town, or you're just looking for great coffee, Queen City Bakery has what you need. The entire Queen City crew works hard to create an atmosphere that is simultaneously approachable and tasteful. Entire families are just as common a sight as business meetings. It is in our job description to make everyone walking through our doors feel welcome. <br>

		Owners Mitch and Kristine go out of their way to produce the highest quality baked goods, all made from scratch daily, with as much local fruit and produce we can get our hands on. Traveling to find a good croissant or quiche is no longer necessary because Queen City Bakery has been making Sioux Falls' pastry-related dreams come true since 2008.<br>

		It's not gourmet, and it's not luxury; it's simply delicious and accessible excellence. <br>
